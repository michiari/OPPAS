This project contains two tools: POMC and POPACheck


## POMC

POMC is a model-checking tool for verifying procedural programs with exceptions against POTL (Precedence Oriented Temporal Logic) specifications.
POTL is a temporal logic capable of expressing context-free specifications, particularly well-suited for verifying procedural programs with exceptions.
It can express properties such as:
- Stack inspection
- Function-local properties
- Hoare-style pre/post conditions for functions
- No-throw guarantee (for exceptions)
- Exception safety


## POPACheck

POAPACheck is a model-checking tool for recursive probabilistic programs formally modelled as probabilistic Operator Precedence Automata (pOPA), a subclass of probabilistic Pushdown Automata.
POPACheck support model checking of the temporal logics LTL and a fragment of POTL.


For usage info, including input/output formats, see the [User Guide](docs/guide.pdf) and related [Publications](#publications).


## Build

The suite has been packaged with the [Haskell Tool Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org/).

It requires development files of the following libraries
- [Z3 Theorem Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) (tested with versions 4.11.2, 4.14.1)
- [BLAS/LAPACK](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/)
- [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
- [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)

On most Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions (including Ubuntu), they can be installed with:
```sh
sudo apt install libz3-dev libgsl0-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev
```

To build the suite, after cloning the repository type the following commands in a terminal:
```sh
stack setup
stack build
```
Stack will automatically download and compile all required packages.
Then, POMC can be executed on an input file `file.pomc` as follows:
```sh
stack exec -- pomc file.pomc
```

And POPACheck as follows:
```sh
stack exec -- popacheck file.pomc
```

For more info, please refer to the User's Guide in `docs`.
We tested the suite mostly on Ubuntu 24.04/24.10.
It may not work on other OS's, and issues have been reported on Ubuntu 22.04.
