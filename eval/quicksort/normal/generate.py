# experiments for comparing POMC with VERA have been handwritten
# the VERA formula we verify is:
#   1) F (ret And main)  ----- BQ.1 - False

# experiments for comparing POMC with MOPED have been handwritten
# the MOPED formulae we verify are 
#   1) F (ret And main) for the buggy version, and   
#   2) F (ok) for the correct version, which both verifies correctness and termination.

# MODELS:
# the model for VERA and MOPED-buggy are the same, modulo the parameter N
# it represents an ABSTRACT version of the Buggy model from the benchmark

# the model for MOPED-correct and Correct (from the benchmark) are the same, modulo the parameters (K,M) AND
# a different way to establish if the array is sorted (MOPED uses variable "ok" and sets it just once at the end,
# Correct uses variable "sorted" and updates it at every swap.)
