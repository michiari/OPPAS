# Note

Each CSV file is a table which contains the experimental results that are displayed in the reported graphs.
The first column and the first row are the header of the table. Columns names indicate the array length (this parameter is elsewhere indicated with letter M), while row names indicate the number of bits used to represent array elements (this parameter is sometimes called K)
